I have create a dashboard on Power BI for HR at a Telecom company reflecting the KPIs pertaining to Diversity & inclusion in order to improve gender balance at the executive management level.

➔ Defined KPIs in hiring, promotion, performance and turnover and calculated them using DAX:

𝐇𝐢𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 Total Employees

▪ # of Men

▪ # of Women

▪ % of Men

▪ % of Women

▪ Hire year

▪ % of Hires Men in FY20

▪ % of Hires Women in FY20


𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞
▪ Average Performance Rating FY19 (Men)

▪ Average Performance Rating FY19 (Women)

▪ Average Performance Rating FY20 (Men)

▪ Average Performance Rating FY20 (Women)

𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐦𝐨𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧

▪ Employees Promoted in FY21

▪ % of Men Promoted in FY20

▪ % of Women Promoted in FY20

▪ % of Men Promoted in FY21

▪ % of Women Promoted in FY21

𝐓𝐮𝐫𝐧𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐫

▪ # of Leavers

▪ % Turnover FY20

▪ Turnover Male in FY20

▪ % Turnover Men in FY20

▪ Turnover Female in FY20

➔ Created an interactive dashboard reflecting the above KPIs and presented the insights in form of cards, clustered column chart, clustered bar chart, donut chart, stacked bar chart, stacked column chart and line chart.

➔ After analyzing the data, we can find that in FY20, the turnover rate of men was higher, and as a result, it is possible that men were given higher promotions in order to reduce this turnover rate.

➔ If we look closely at the senior officer level, in FY20 the turnover rate was higher for women, and that's why more women were promoted to that job level in FY21.

➔ In the strategy department, in FY20 there were no women leavers, and in FY21 promotions, we see 33.3% of women were promoted.

➔ In conclusion, this slow progress could be due to the higher turnover rate among men.
